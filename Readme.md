#IS135 Tutorials
*We will be completing several tutorial exercises every week. Many will come from the textbook. The rest are covered here. You will find them linked in each week's class agenda on Blackboard.*

* Each tutorial has a number and a name. [Tutorial #1](T1_Setup.md) is about setting up your computer for this course. It also covers some basics of using the software for everyday tasks. The filename is then `T1_Setup.md`. 
* If here are mutiple parts to a tutorial then each part will be covered in a separate file. The filename will indciate the part accordingly. 
* You can make your own copy of these instructions using *fork* and *clone*. An example of how to do that is given in Tutorial #1.
